# Rock-vs-Mine-using-Sonar-Data
This project predicts whether a sonar signal corresponds to a Rock (R) or a Mine (M) using machine learning. The dataset contains 60 numerical sonar features and a target label indicating the type of object. The model is built using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for high accuracy and robust classification.
